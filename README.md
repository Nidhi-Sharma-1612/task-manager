# Task Management App

This README provides instructions to set up and run the Task Management App locally, along with details about design choices and assumptions made.

## Deployed App

The app is deployed and accessible at: https://task-manager-ntnd.vercel.app/

## Steps to Set Up and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for the mock backend

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Set Up the Mock Backend

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the JSON Server with the provided `db.json` file:
   ```bash
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```
   The mock API will now be available at `http://localhost:5000/tasks`.

### Run the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.

## Design Choices

### 1. **Ant Design for UI Components**

- The app uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for consistent and responsive UI components, reducing the need to build custom components from scratch.
- Buttons, Modals, and Tables are styled with Ant Design components to ensure a polished and professional look.

### 2. **JSON Server for Backend**

- A lightweight mock backend using JSON Server to simulate API interactions.
- The `db.json` file serves as the database, providing tasks data for CRUD operations.

### 3. **Component Structure**

- **`TaskTable`**: Renders tasks in a paginated, sortable table.
- **`TaskForm`**: Provides a form for adding and editing tasks.
- **`App`**: Manages application state and serves as the main entry point.

### 4. **Sorting and Formatting**

- Tasks are sorted by due date in ascending order by default for better user experience.
- Due dates are displayed in the `day, month, year` format using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for clarity.

### 5. **Responsive Design**

- The layout uses TailwindCSS and Ant Design's responsiveness features to ensure the app works well on different screen sizes.

### 6. **Form Handling**

- Form validation is implemented to ensure data integrity.
- The Ant Design form automatically resets fields after submission or when the modal is closed.

## Assumptions

- Tasks always have a unique `id` generated by the backend or mock server.
- `priority` is limited to three predefined levels: High, Medium, and Low.
- `status` represents the completion state of a task as a boolean value.
- The app is designed for demonstration purposes and is not optimized for production use.

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication and user roles for task management.
- Integration with a real backend (e.g., Node.js, Express, or Firebase).
- Improved accessibility and dark mode support.
- Unit tests for better reliability and maintainability.
